# `card-table` — a reusable card animation module

A self-contained, game-agnostic module for the visual half of a card game: **selecting, playing,
dealing, and animating cards onto a discard pile**, plus other players' fanned card backs. It knows
nothing about rules, turns, scoring, boards, or pawns — a host game drives it imperatively and
supplies its own geometry through one small seam.

It was extracted from the Keezen/Tock board game but carries no Keezen specifics; the goal is to drop
it into a future card game and reuse the whole "hand → play → fly → pile" experience.

- **`CardTable`** — the engine. A framework-light class (Angular signals, **no template**) that owns
  the pile, the in-flight "flyer" layer and the deal-in animation state, and computes every card's
  on-table position. Unit-testable like a plain state machine.
- **`<app-card-layer>`** — a dumb, `OnPush` presentational component. It renders whatever the engine
  computes and raises click/hover events. No game logic.
- **`CardPositioner`** — the seam. Your game decides _where_ cards live (hand fan, pile stack, deck
  anchor). A `DefaultCardPositioner` ships a sensible linear-fan + spiral-pile layout.
- **`<app-card>`** — one playing card, drawn from a sprite sheet (bundled `card-deck.png` by default,
  swappable per game).

## Quick start

```ts
import { CardTable } from './card-table/card-table';
import { DefaultCardPositioner } from './card-table/default-positioner';
import { CardLayer } from './card-table/card-layer';

@Component({
  imports: [CardLayer /* … */],
  template: `
    <div class="play" style="--hand-top: 70%">
      <app-card-layer
        [cards]="table.cards()"
        [flyers]="table.flyers()"
        [backs]="opponentBacks()"
        [options]="table.options"
        [selectedUuid]="selectedUuid()"
        [isSpecial]="isSpecial"
        (cardClick)="onCardClick($event)"
        (cardHover)="onCardHover($event)"
      />
    </div>
  `,
})
export class MyGame {
  // 1. Give the engine your hand (a signal of CardFace[]) and a layout.
  private readonly positioner = new DefaultCardPositioner();
  protected readonly table = new CardTable(() => this.hand(), this.positioner);

  // 2. Which card values get the "special" highlight (your rules decide).
  protected readonly isSpecial = (value: number) => value === 1 || value === 13;

  // 3. Drive it from your own server/state diffing:
  onDealt(newUuids: number[]) {
    this.table.dealIn(newUuids);
  }
  onIPlayed(card: CardVM) {
    this.table.flyToPile(card, { pop: true });
  }
  onNewRound() {
    this.table.clearPile();
  }
}
```

That's the whole contract: **feed it the hand + a positioner, render `<app-card-layer>`, and call
the four methods when your game state changes.**

### Tuning the feel

Pass `CardTableOptions` (all fields optional) as the third constructor argument to retune timings and
scales; the rest fall back to `DEFAULT_CARD_TABLE_OPTIONS`:

```ts
new CardTable(() => this.hand(), positioner, { flyMs: 350, dealStaggerMs: 500, pileScale: 0.5 });
```

| Option                                 | Default               | Meaning                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flyMs`                                | `500`                 | Fly-to-pile duration (drives the CSS transition + flip keyframes too). |
| `popMs`                                | `180`                 | How long the own card swells + glows before it flies.                  |
| `dealFlipMs`                           | `550`                 | Dealt-card turnover as it fans out.                                    |
| `dealStaggerMs`                        | `700`                 | Stagger between dealt cards.                                           |
| `tradeRevealMs`                        | `560`                 | When a traded-in card is unmasked (relative to its flyer launch).      |
| `pileScale` / `deckScale` / `fanScale` | `0.6` / `0.3` / `0.3` | Card scale on the pile / at the deck / in a fan.                       |
| `popScale`                             | `1.2`                 | Own-card swell during the pop beat.                                    |

`CardTable` resolves these into `table.options`; bind `[options]="table.options"` on `<app-card-layer>`
and it publishes the timing values as CSS vars (`--ct-fly-ms`, `--ct-pop-ms`, `--ct-deal-flip-ms`,
`--ct-deck-scale`) so the engine's `setTimeout`s and the SCSS transitions/keyframes **stay in sync
from one source**.

## The seams (what a host game provides)

| Seam                | How                                                     | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hand**            | `new CardTable(() => this.hand(), …)`                   | A `Signal<CardFace[]>` (or getter) of the viewer's cards.            |
| **Layout**          | a `CardPositioner`                                      | Where the hand fan, pile stack and pile/deck centre sit — see below. |
| **Backs**           | `[backs]` input                                         | Other players' face-down fans (your board geometry positions them).  |
| **Highlight**       | `[isSpecial]` input                                     | Which card _values_ get the gold "special" ring (your rules).        |
| **Selection**       | `[selectedUuid]` input                                  | The lifted/ringed card (your selection state).                       |
| **Vertical offset** | `--hand-top` CSS var                                    | Where the layer's box starts (the layer is `display: contents`).     |
| **Sprite sheet**    | `--card-sheet` / `--card-cols` / `--card-rows` CSS vars | Swap in a different deck image + grid.                               |

### `CardPositioner`

```ts
interface CardPositioner {
  handSlot(index: number, count: number): Pos; // fanned hand
  pileSlot(index: number): Pos; // stacked pile (incl. scale + z)
  pileCenter(): Pos; // fly-to-pile landing + deal-from anchor
}
```

All coordinates are in **the card-layer's own percentage space** (`x`/`y` are `%` for `left`/`top`
of the layer box). Provide your own to match your board, or use `DefaultCardPositioner`. Fly-in
_origins/targets_ (an opponent's fan, a trade partner) are **not** on the positioner — they're passed
straight into the engine's animation methods, because they're your board geometry, not table layout.

### The sprite sheet

`<app-card>` draws one cell of a grid. `suit` selects the row, `value` selects the column
(`--card-col` = `value - 1`, so `value` is 1-based: ace = 1). To use a different deck, set on any
ancestor:

```css
.my-game {
  --card-sheet: url('/assets/my-deck.png');
  --card-cols: 13; /* columns in the sheet */
  --card-rows: 4; /* rows in the sheet    */
}
```

The default `card-deck.png` is a component-relative asset, so the bundler hashes it and it resolves
under any `<base href>` — no app-level wiring needed.

### `<app-card-layer>` (component)

**Inputs:** `cards: CardVM[]`, `flyers: Flyer[]`, `backs: CardBackVM[]`,
`selectedUuid: number | null`, `isSpecial: (value: number) => boolean`,
`options: ResolvedCardTableOptions` (publishes the timing CSS vars).
**Outputs:** `cardClick: number` (uuid), `cardHover: number | null` (value).

---

## Coordinate system

The layer is `display: contents`, so it positions inside whatever box you place it in. Give that box
`position: relative` (or absolute) and a `--hand-top`. All engine/positioner `x`/`y` are percentages
of that box. The Keezen host, for example, works in a 600px board space and its positioner divides
pixel coordinates by 6 to reach `%`.

---

## What it deliberately does **not** include

- **Game rules** — legal moves, turn order, scoring, must-play, etc.
- **Board / pawn** rendering and movement — a different concern; keep it in your game.
- **Board geometry** — where each seat's fan sits on _your_ board. You compute fly-in origins and the
  `backs` positions; the module just renders and animates them.
- **Server/state wiring** — you diff your own game state and call the four engine methods.

---

## Porting checklist

1. Render `<app-card-layer>` inside a positioned box that sets `--hand-top`.
2. Construct `CardTable(() => yourHandSignal(), positioner)`. Start with `DefaultCardPositioner`;
   write your own `CardPositioner` if your table isn't a linear fan + central pile.
3. Map your cards to `CardFace { uuid, suit, value }` (stable `uuid`; `suit` = sprite row,
   `value` = 1-based sprite column).
4. Point `--card-sheet` / `--card-cols` / `--card-rows` at your deck (or reuse `card-deck.png`).
5. Call `dealIn` on a deal, `flyToPile` when a card is played, `tradeSwap` for a swap, `clearPile`
   on a new round. Feed `[backs]` for opponents' fans and `[isSpecial]`/`[selectedUuid]` for highlights.

---

## Known couplings & tuning notes

- **Timing is single-sourced.** All durations/scales live in `CardTableOptions`; the engine uses the
  numbers for its `setTimeout`s and `<app-card-layer>` publishes them as CSS vars, so the SCSS
  transitions (`card-layer.scss`) and flip keyframes (`card/card.scss`) follow automatically. Change
  a value in one place (the options) and both TS and CSS update. Only the internal `LAND_BUFFER_MS`
  (how long after the flight the flyer swaps to a pile element) and `DEAL_CLEAR_BUFFER_MS` are fixed.
- **`deckScale` ↔ card back.** The card `.back` border widths are `calc(2px / var(--ct-deck-scale))`,
  so the stacked back matches full-size opponent backs at any deck scale — no manual adjustment.
- **Selector prefix.** Components use the app's `app-` selector prefix. If you publish this as a
  standalone library, give it a library-specific prefix instead.
- **Writable `pile` signal.** `pile` is exposed writable for the rare no-animation land
  (`pile.update(...)`) and for tests; treat it as read-mostly and prefer the methods.
