/**
 * Manages the game-state SSE connection: it opens an `EventSource`, parses each `gamestate` event
 * into a {@link GameStatePush} for the caller, and — because the server sends a fresh personalized
 * snapshot on every (re)subscribe — re-establishes the stream after a short backoff if the browser
 * gives up on it (readyState CLOSED). Without that resync a dropped stream leaves a STALE board
 * that then rejects moves as "not your turn" (ported from the GWT presenter's onError resync).
 *
 * Pure transport: the caller supplies the URL and handles the domain diffing in {@link onState};
 * {@link onReconnect} fires on each (re)connect so it can drop any per-stream baseline (so the
 * reconnect snapshot isn't mistaken for a new move/deal).
